Added a function that generates a student list and sorts them to nerds and noobs.
Below you can see program's performance generating different amount of student lists.

| Number of students | Duration (seconds) |
|:------------------:|--------------------|

|       10 000       |          4         |
|       100 000      |         10         |
|      1 000 000     |         29         |
