### Implemented the program using C arrays and vectors.

**Implementation with C arrays**
- Input is read from console.
- Students structure and their grades are dynamically saved.
- Poor performance due to copying.

 **Implementation with vectors**
- Input is read from console.
- Students structure and their grades are saved using vectors.
- Better performance.

Implemented security that won't let the user input wrong data.
